# HackKU's Helper Discord Bot! üê£

## What's helper duck? ü§î
For HackKU24, we launched helper duck! helper duck is a discord bot that functions as a system for hackers to submit help tickets to
mentors. Read about how helper duck works on the HackKU24 [hackerdoc](https://hackku.notion.site/Helper-Duck-d747497ddbc24a2f8f27b3bee1f7f4e2).

## Setting up helper duck ‚öôÔ∏è
To run helper duck, you will need Python and SQLite3 installed your system.
First install the modules in `requirements.txt`. Secondly, initialize the database by running

```
sqlite3 database.db < db_init.sql
```

where `database.db` is the name of the database file you would like helper duck to use.
Next, you will need to configure helper duck. Create a file named `config.json` and fill it out as follows:

```
{
  "DB_FILE": "<name of database file from above>",
  "MENTOR_CHANNEL_ID": <mentor private channel id from discord>,
  "HELP_CHANNEL_ID": <channel for helper duck to create threads in>,
  "GUILD_ID": <id of your hackathons discord server>,
  "MENTOR_ROLE_ID": <id of the role only mentors have in discord>,
  "ORGANIZER_ROLE_ID": <if of the role only organizers have in discord>,
  "API_TOKEN": "<discord api token>"
}
```

replacing the quantities in angle brackets with their appropriate values. A couple notes:

- You can find the various IDs of objects within Discord by turning on developer mode in your Discord client. Now, if you right click the
server/role/channel you want the ID of, you will see a new option on the context menu to copy the ID.
- The Discord API token can be generated by creating a new app and bot in the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
  Make sure to invite helper duck to your server!

After that, off to the races! üèÅ Just run 

```
python3 main.py
```

Happy hacking! üçª
